[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/simonpcouch/anyflights.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/simonpcouch/anyflights) [![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/simonpcouch/anyflights/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/simonpcouch/anyflights?branch=master)

The `anyflights` package supplies a set of functions to query air travel data similar to those found in [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13). With a user-defined year and airport, the `anyflights` function will grab data on:

* `flights`: all flights that departed a given airport in a given year and month
* `weather`: hourly meterological data for a given airport in a given year and month
* `airports`: airport names, FAA codes, and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier (airline) codes and names
* `planes`: construction information about each plane found in `flights`

The package also exports a set of functions to query each of the above datasets individually. Each of the functions are named `get_*` followed with the names of the datasets (shown above in `code`), and require a varying combination of the `station` (character vector of FAA LID airport codes), `year` (as an integer), and `month` (integer vector) arguments. Optionally, the user can also supply a `dir` argument (filepath to a folder) to save the resulting datasets. 

These functions require a *strong* connection to run; expect several minutes of runtime, especially for the `anyflights` and `get_flights` functions.

The FAA usually posts all of the data for a given year during February or March of the following year. All airports with an FAA LID code are supported, to my knowledge.

### Installation

------

`anyflights` can be installed with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("simonpcouch/anyflights")
```

### Basic Usage

------

To grab a named list of 5 dataframes giving `nycflights13`-like air travel data for the Portland International Airport during June 2019, you could call:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdxflights19 <- anyflights("PDX", 2019, 6)
```

To grab the original `nycflights13` datasets, try:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nycflights13_ <- anyflights(c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR"), 2013)
```

The package also provides an `as_flights_package` function to create a data-only package from the data outputted by `anyflights`. To create the package from the data, just supply a name:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdxflights19 %>%
  as_flights_package("pdxflights")
```

and check out the data-only package in the `pdxflights` directory! `r emo::ji("bug")`
